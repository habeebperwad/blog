<p>I am Habeeb Perwad, working as web developer in Bangalore, India. I love to work on Linux OS especially Ubuntu.</p>
<h2>Why am I  blogging?</h2>
<p>I always do some research before doing new things on code. Such research will bring many thoughts on my mind. Most of the thoughts are some concepts only. I want to compile such concepts as an article here.<br />
