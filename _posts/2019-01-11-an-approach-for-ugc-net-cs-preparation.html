	<li><b><s>Everything is available in Internet.</s></b><br/>  
That is right. But It will be distraction. Get necessary books/guides. Use internet as additional tool.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>

	<li><b>How to use Internet effectively?</b><br/>
		<ul>

			<li>Internet is a distraction and should be used as secondary source!!</li>
			<li>There are amazing teachers in youtube! Use videos only for complicated topics. Don’t waste time by watching videos for every topic.</li>
			<li>Use google voice search for search. Typing will be a distraction.</li>
			<li>Most of the google search results in the first page may not be good articles. I usually add <b>site:.edu</b> at the end of search query for better articles.</li>
			<li>I don’t recommend any website. Let you find yourself via searching each topics or problems.</li>
			</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>


	<li><b>Should I need books for every subjects?</b><br/>

It depends upon you! I have some idea about all computer science subjects. Note the point: I have only idea not knowledge. Only subject book(hard copy) I used: An introduction to formal languages and automata by Peter Linz
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>


<li><b>What are the recommended books?</b><br/>

I strongly recommend to get three guides for paper 1, paper 2/3 and previous questions and answers for Paper 2/3. The following books are I used. I am not strongly recommending those books. 

<ul>
	<li>Trueman's UGC NET/SET General Paper I: 
It will give you good idea about paper 1. Don’t need to cover all topics in depth.
	</li>

	<li>Arihant’s UGC-CSIR NET (JRF &amp; LS)Computer Science &amp; Applications:
It cover most of the topics from Paper II and III. I think some of the articles in the book are cut-and-paste from Internet. I don’t believe there will be a perfect book for paper 2 and 3. Most of the questions given in this book are not worth considering. But just look at those questions and mark important questions yourself for revision.

	</li>
	<li>
Upkar’s UGC NET/JRF Exam Solved Papers Computer Science &amp; Applications:
Previous questions papers will helpful to you understand the problems they are asking. Conduct mock test with time constraint. Don’t worry if you get less marks; 56% mark was the cutoff for Nov 2017.
	</li>
</ul>

After exam you may feel those books are not much worth. But the basic idea of getting those books is to stop you from wandering. Otherwise you may searching for perfect books and never start studying! 



<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><b>Should I cover all subjects?</b><br/>

It is your call. I had touched almost all topics except current trends and technologies(CTT) and Linear Programming Problem(LPP)! I think any questions can be asked from CTT. I thought it is not worth spending time for CTT. I studied LPP extensively for my statistics graduation. LPP contains excessive computational problems (Am I wrong?). We don’t have much time in exam. Better avoid spending time for computations!!


<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><b>How to study?</b><br/>

No need to cover every details. Some topics won’t have much points but just explanations. Identify the core topics yourself and study well. Make sure to prepare short notes for every topics. It will be great help for revision. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>


<li><b>Should I practice?</b><br/>

Yes! There are many problems to solve like task scheduling algorithms, page replacement algorithms, disk scheduling algorithms, etc. Don’t just understand it; practice it well.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>


<li><b>Anything else?</b><br/>


	<ul><li>There is no negative marks and no optional questions. Make sure you attend all questions.</li>
		<li>Relaxed in exam hall and take a deep breath :)</li>
		<li>My approach may not be right for you. Trust yourself. The only person who know you well is you only. Plan and study the way suitable to you. </li>
		<li>Go and get it!! All the best!</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>
