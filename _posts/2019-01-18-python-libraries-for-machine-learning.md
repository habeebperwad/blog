Numerous data processing and machine learning related libraries make the python programming language best choice for machine learning projects. Here is the list of python libraries I want you should include in your machine learning toolkit.


#### Numpy
Providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with large collection of functions to operate on these arrays.


#### Pandas
Supports data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. 


#### Matplotlib
It is 2D ploting library. Data visualization is crucial to better understand the data. It works well with Numpy.


#### Scikit-learn
It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting and k-means, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.


#### Tensorflow
TensorFlow is a low-level library that allows you to build machine learning models (and other computations) using a set of simple operators, like "add", "matmul", "concat", etc. scikit-learn is a higher-level library that includes implementations of several machine learning algorithms.

#### NLTK
It is a collection of sample data, libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing for English. It supports classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning functionalities.
